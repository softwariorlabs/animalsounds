These Terms of Services govern the Services, as well as all content included in or made available through the Services, such as text, graphics, logos, images, audio clips, stories, meditations and digital downloads (the “Content”), as well as Updates (as defined below).

Housekeeping Rules

When you use our Services, we ask that you follow very simple housekeeping rules. We also ask you not to encourage others to break this rule, or to help them doing so – that would also be considered a breach by you of our housekeeping rules.

The rules are the following. Please do not:

attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services, or otherwise circumvent any software protection or monitoring mechanisms of the Services;

Licenses

Our Apps are licensed, not sold, to you.

Subject to your respect of these Terms of Services, and during the Term, we grant you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited and worldwide license to download, install, use and access our Services for your personal use. This license applies to the devices that you own or control, and is subject to the Mobile Operators terms and conditions, such as Apple’s Usage Rules. There are a few limits to this license:

You may not distribute or make the licence available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time, unless through family sharing or similar functionalities made available by your Mobile Operator;
You may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense our Apps and, if you sell your device to a third party, you must remove our Apps from your device before doing so;
You may not copy (except as permitted by the Terms of Services), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify or create derivative works of our Apps, any updates or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with our Apps).
You acknowledge and agree that Mobile Operators, and their subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of these Terms of Services to the extent that they relate to our Apps. As of the Effective Date, the Mobile Operators will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms of Services against you as a third party beneficiary thereof regarding the Apps. 

Subscription Fees and Payments

We offer paid subscriptions on a weekly, monthly or annual basis. We may also offer life subscriptions that are valid for 100 years, or until we cease to commercially offer the Services. Additional terms and conditions may apply to life subscriptions. Life subscription is paid for by a one-off upfront payment.

Except for life subscription, subscriptions are auto-renewing at the end of each periodic subscription term. You understand and agree that (i) after your initial subscription period, this period will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period and (ii) your account will be billed continuously for each subscription, until you terminate it. 

You can terminate and manage your Apps subscription(s) directly from your mobile devices, or directly within our Services in the settings. If you terminate your subscription, you will continue to have access to the paid Services until the end of the subscription period that you already paid for, and we will not charge you additional fees after the end of this subscription period.

You hereby authorize us to collect payments for each paid subscription period to which you subscribed on your credit card or through the payment method(s) that we make available to you and you have selected. You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using your account registered to your name.

You agree to provide accurate, complete and current financial information. If your financial information changes, we will not be able to process the payment for your subsequent subscription term until you update your financial information.

We reserve our right to revise our subscription fees and offerings at any time. If the subscription fees change, we will advise you before processing your next payments. If you do not agree to such changes, you can terminate your subscription before the next payment. 

We use third party service providers to process your payment as part of our Services, such as Stripe. They process your financial information in accordance with their privacy policies, and conduct fraud prevention and anti-money laundering monitoring for legal compliance purposes. In no event will we be responsible for the actions or inactions of third party payment processors, including, but not limited to, system downtime or payment service outages, unless such actions are in breach of these Terms of Services.

Gifting of Service

We offer the opportunity to buy pre-paid subscriptions that can be given to other individuals (each a “Recipient”). If you purchase a prepaid membership, you agree and acknowledge that the Recipient must be at least 18 years old. 

Once you purchase the pre-paid subscription, you will receive an order confirmation, a receipt and a gifting code that can be redeemed by the Recipient to access the Services for the period of time corresponding to your pre-paid subscription.

Gifting codes can only be used once in the country for which they were purchased and cannot be redeemed for cash, resold or combined with any other offers, including free trial. Please note that gifting codes cannot be redeemed if the Recipient has already purchased a subscription with us directly or through a Mobile Operator.

If you buy a prepaid subscription, we will automatically bill you based on the payment method you selected at the time of purchase. We will notify the Recipient prior to the end of the prepaid subscription that it is about to expire.

We have no liability and we are not responsible for lost and stolen gifting codes, or if gifting codes are used without permission.

Promotion and Discount Codes

From time to time, we may decide to offer promotions and discounts codes. You cannot combine promotions and discounts. We may decide to offer promotions and discounts only to a certain group of users or to potential new users. You agree and understand that you may not qualify for all available promotions and discounts. Unless stated otherwise, promotions and discounts only apply to the initial subscription periods, and any renewals will be charged at the then-current rates for our subscriptions.

Group Subscriptions

We offer group subscriptions to employers and other groups of individuals (the “Group Subscription”). The Group Subscription is managed by administrators of the Services (the “Administrators”). 

To access and use the Group Subscription, the Administrators will provide you with a link to a webpage where you can register your accounts. The Administrators may impose different conditions to ensure that only their authorized end users are accessing their Group Subscription, such as ensuring that your e-mails domain used to register the accounts match those identified or used by the Administrators. 

Administrators are responsible for managing the Group Subscription, which means that they : (a) can remove, delete or suspend your account at any time; (b) determine the term of your subscription, which means that your subscription may be available for a predetermined period; (c) can see aggregated data about the Group Subscription, such as how often the Services are used and which functionalities are popular and (d) may impose additional conditions on your use of the Group Subscription. Once you cease to be an authorized user of the Group Subscription, if you want to continue to use our Services, you may have to create new accounts, and you may not be able to access your Content after the Group Subscription ends. 

While Group Subscriptions are generally provided free of charge to authorized users, there may be cases where Group Subscriptions are provided at a discounted rate to authorized users.

Group Subscriptions may different from one group to another group based on the contractual provisions that the Administrators have requested. If you have questions on your Group Subscription and the applicable modalities, you should contact your Administrators. 

Refund Policy

You agree and understand that the Services and gifting codes are non-refundable and we do not issue credits for the Services and gifting codes. If we suspend your account in accordance with these Terms of Services, or if you close your account voluntarily, you agree and understand that you will receive no refund or exchange of any kind for the Services, except as set forth in applicable laws.
