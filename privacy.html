<h2 id="h.tyjcwt"><strong>Interest-Based Advertising&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>What is interest-based advertising ?</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Interest-based advertising is also referred to as targeted advertising or behavioral advertising.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply put, we collect personal information about you which we or our partners use to provide you with ads which are relevant to you.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. We collect data about your behavior on our freeApps – such as how long you spend meditating, and how often. It’s important to understand that this behavior is linked to an anonymous <a href="#h.30j0zll">cookie ID</a>, and not to directly identifying information such as your name, address or credit card number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The behavior linked to the anonymous <a href="#h.30j0zll">cookie ID</a> can then be used for retargeting or advertising.. For instance, we could target all users who are meditating frequently with a specific promotion based on their usage. We can also use this behavior linked to the anonymous <a href="#h.30j0zll">cookie ID</a> as part of real-time bidding (RTB).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Real-time bidding is a type of automated buying of advertising placements.If a third party decides to buy the data associated with the anonymous <a href="#h.30j0zll">cookie ID</a>, it is then provided with data such as an encrypted email or mobile advertising identifiers which is used to serve you with the relevant ads – such as comfortable pillows for a better sleep!</p>
<p>If you want to opt-out of interest-based advertising<a href="#h.3dy6vkm">, click here to jump to the right section of this policy</a>. You can also visit the <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools">Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada</a> for more information on the tools available to you to control your participation in interest-based advertising.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Do you conduct interest-based advertising, and how?</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We conduct interest-based advertising on the free versions of our Apps. This allows us to deliver these services without cost to you. Otherwise, you can use the paid versions of our Apps – we will not use your data for interest-based advertising if you pay for our services. We also conduct interest-based advertising through some of our websites. <em>Click here for examples of how we conduct interest-based advertising.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We use third parties such ad exchanges to deliver interest-based advertising&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Through our free mobile Apps, we conduct real-time bidding to automate the buying of advertising placements. In order to effectively sell our advertising placements, we use MoPub, which is an ad exchange. This means that MoPub is an intermediary which itself resells to other networks. These third parties have access to mobile advertising identifiers which are then used to serve the ads. We can use other parties than MoPub to deliver interest-based advertising.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>We use Facebook for re-targeting&nbsp;</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may display interest-based ads to you when you are using Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook called the <strong>Custom Audience Tool</strong>. This tool allows us to personalize our ads based on your behavior. We do not share any of your personal information, including your behavior, with Facebook. The tool lets us convert your email address to a unique number that Facebook uses to match to unique numbers it generates from email addresses of its users as part of real-time bidding.</p>
<p>With your permission, we can also use <strong>Facebook Conversion Tracking Pixel</strong> to record how efficient our advertisements are for statistical and market research purposes. The collected data remains anonymous. This means that we cannot see the personal data of individual users. Facebook may connect the data with your Facebook account and use the data for their own advertising purposes, in accordance with its current privacy policy, which you can find <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>We use Google Analytics for retargeting</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Analytics offers a function about remarketing audiences. It allows us to create segments based on the analytics that we have obtained, and then use it as part of remarketing campaigns on our Google Ads account. Google Ads uses a different cookie than Google Analytic.&nbsp;</p>
